# assemble-render-file [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/assemble-render-file.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assemble-render-file) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/assemble-render-file.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/assemble-render-file)

> Assemble plugin for rendering views in a vinyl pipeline.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm i assemble-render-file --save
```

## Usage

```js
var renderFile = require('assemble-render-file');
var assemble = require('assemble');

// register as an instance plugin with assemble
var app = assemble()
  .use(renderFile());

// then use in a vinyl pipeline
app.src('*.hbs')
  .pipe(app.renderfile())
  .pipe(app.dest('foo'));
```

### noop engine

By default, when no engine is found for a file an error is thrown. To get around this you can either define a `noop` engine, or use disable the [engineStrict option](#optionsengineStrict).

A noop engine follows the same signature as any engine, but must be registered using the key: `noop`.

**Example**

```js
app.engine('noop', function(view, opts, next) {
  // do whatever you want to `view`, or nothing
  next(null, view);
});
```

## Options

### options.engineStrict

By default, when no engine is found for a file an error is thrown. This can be disabled with the following:

```js
app.option('engineStrict', false);
```

When disabled and an engine is not found, files are just passed through.
